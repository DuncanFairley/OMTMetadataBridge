OMT Metadata Bridge - README
---------------------------------------------------------------------
OMT Metadata Bridge is a piece of software that sits between OMT iMediaTouch and your Icecast server. iMediaTouch doesn't support streaming itself, so a seperate program such as Edcast is used to send the audio. As Edcast won't have access to the currently playing song's metadata, iMediaTouch can be configured to send that information via UDP to this Bridge, which will pass it along to your icecast server in a variety of ways. (File, MySQL and Icecast itself initially)

OMT Metadata Bridge is distributed under the GNU GPL, version 2. A copy of this license is included with this software in the LICENSE file.
